## Overview

Welcome to the Doodle Jump Clone! This game is inspired by the classic Doodle Jump and offers a fun and challenging platforming experience. Jump endlessly, defeat zombies, collect power-ups, and aim for the highest score!

## Features

### Endless Jumping
- Doodle is constantly jumping off randomly generated tiles, making the game potentially endless.

### Challenging Obstacles
- Avoid falling off the tiles or colliding with zombies to stay alive.

### Score Tracker
- Keep an eye on your current score in the top-left corner of the screen.

### Precise Controls
- Control Doodle's left-right movement with the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

### Projectile Shooting
- Left-click the mouse to launch projectiles in the direction you choose. Hold the left mouse button for continuous shooting.

### Zombie Elimination
- Kill zombies by either shooting projectiles at them or jumping on their heads.

### Dynamic Tiles
- Some tiles are painted in red and vanish after a single jump, while others are permanent.

### Black Holes
- Black holes affect Doodle's movement by gravitating it towards them.

### Easter Eggs
- Discover easter eggs randomly scattered across the tiles. Collecting them temporarily changes Doodle's skin to a bunny costume and grants a 2x jump boost.
